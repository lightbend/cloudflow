#### Spark

We build our own Spark distribution because we are targeting by default Scala 2.12 which is not the default language for Spark v2.4.x.

The [buildLightbendSpark.sh](multi-base-images/spark/buildLightbendSpark.sh) script:

1. Creates an appropriate Spark distribution. 
2. Builds and pushes a Spark image to be used as a Cloudflow application base image
3. Builds and pushes a Spark Operator image.

#### Strimzi

Cloudflow uses the official Strimzi releases and the related publicly available artifacts.
