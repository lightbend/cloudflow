 * The [[ServerStreamletLogic]] provides a `containerPort` and a `getContainerPort()` method.
 * It returns the TCP port that is opened on the container. Listen on all interfaces ("0.0.0.0") and use the port
 * returned by `containerPort` to start a TCP server that will be exposed by an endpoint in Kubernetes.
