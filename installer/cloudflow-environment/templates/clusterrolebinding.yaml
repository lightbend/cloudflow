# This gives the service account that runs all core Cloudflow
# services the cluster role "admin", which might be slightly
# too wide-ranging but certainly not as wide as "cluster-admin"
#
# At a later time we might want to declare a custom ClusterRole
# with slightly less permissions than the "admin" role but at
# this time it is unclear which permissions we could remove
# without causing problems for the functionality we foresee
# in the core services.
