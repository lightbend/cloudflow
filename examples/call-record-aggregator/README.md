## Akka and Spark-based Cloudflow Application


### Problem Definition

This application aggregates streaming data for phone call records. It's a mixed Cloudflow application consisting of Akka and Spark-based streamlets.

### Sub projects

This application consists of the following sub-projects:

* `akka-cdr-ingestor`: Akka streams based data ingestion, merging and validation
* `spark-aggregation`: Spark based aggregation of data coming from the ingestor streamlets
* `akka-java-aggregation-output`: Egress implementation for logging in Java
* `call-record-pipelines`: Contains the blueprint
* `datamodel`: Contains the Avro schema


### Example Deployment example on GKE

**Steps:**

* Make sure you have installed a GKE cluster with Cloudflow running.
Make sure you have access to your cluster:

```bash
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials <CLUSTER_NAME>
```

and that you have access to the Google docker registry:

```bash
$ gcloud auth configure-docker
```

* Add the Google docker registry to your sbt project (should be adjusted to your setup). The following lines should be there in the file `target-env.sbt` at the root of your application. e.g.

```
ThisBuild / cloudflowDockerRegistry := Some("eu.gcr.io")
ThisBuild / cloudflowDockerRepository := Some("my-awesome-project")
```

`my-awesome-project` refers to the project ID of your Google Cloud Platform project.

* Build the application:

```bash
$ sbt buildApp
```
At the very end you should see the application image built and instructions for how to deploy it:

* Make sure you have the `kubectl cloudflow` plugin configured.

```bash
$ kubectl cloudflow help
This command line tool can be used to deploy and operate Cloudflow applications.
...
```

* Deploy the app using the command mentioned in the output above.

```bash
$ kubectl cloudflow deploy /Users/myuser/lightbend-repos/cloudflow/examples/call-record-aggregator/target/call-record-aggregator.json
Existing value will be used for configuration parameter 'cdr-generator2.records-per-second'

Existing value will be used for configuration parameter 'cdr-aggregator.watermark'
[Done] Deployment of application `call-record-aggregator` has started.
```

*  Verify it is deployed correctly.

```bash
$ kubectl cloudflow list
