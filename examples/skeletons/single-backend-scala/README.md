# Cloudflow project template

This is a template project with a minimal implementation to provide guidance on how to get started developing applications with Cloudflow.


In this template, you find core elements that comprise a Cloudflow application:
- An AVRO schema defining the data type(s) used in the application
- Streamlets implementing the business logic
- A blueprint that connects the streamlets together

This should provide a concrete departure point to start developing your Cloudflow application!
