To understand the value that Cloudflow offers, let's break down the typical _design-develop-test-package-deploy_ &nbsp;lifecycle of an application and see how Cloudflow helps at each stage to accelerate the end-to-end process.

== Designing Streaming Applications

When creating streaming applications, a large portion of the development effort goes into the _mechanics_ of streaming. 
These include configuring and setting up connections to the messaging system, serializing and deserializing messages, setting up fault-recovery storage, and more. 
All of these mechanics must be addressed before you can finally add the most important and valuable part--business logic.

.Business Logic in a Streaming Application
[caption="Fig 2. - "]
image::business-logic.png[]

Cloudflow introduces a new component model, called _Streamlets_. 
The Streamlet model offers an abstraction to:

- Identify the connections of a component as inlets and outlets, relieving you from setting up connections.
- Attach the schema of the data for each connection, providing type safety at compile time, automatic serialization/deserialization, and avoiding potentially critical issues at deployment.
- Provide an entry point for the business logic of the component, allowing you to focus on coding the most valuable business-specific logic.

== Develop Focusing on Your Business Logic

In the current version, Cloudflow includes backend `Streamlet` implementations for Akka, Apache Spark - Structured Streaming, and Apache Flink. 
Using these implementations you can write business logic in the native API of the backend.
Additionally, Cloudflow can be extended with new streaming backends.

The following table shows the current support for Java and Scala implementations for each supported runtime.

.Scala|Java Support for Streamlet implementations
|===
|Streamlet API|Scala|Java
|Akka| X | X
|Flink| X | X
|Spark Structured Streaming| X |
|===

=== A Streamlet Example

Let's take a look at the parts of a Streamlet in the following example:

.Spark Streamlet Example
[source, scala]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$spark-scala/src/main/scala/cloudflow/sparkdoc/MovingAverageSparklet.scala[tag=spark-streamlet-example]
----

<1> `SparkStreamlet` is the base class that defines `Streamlet` for the Apache Spark backend.
<2> The `StreamletShape` defines the inlet(s) and outlet(s) of the `Streamlet`, each inlet/outlet is declared with its corresponding data type.
<3> `buildStreamletQueries` is the entry point for the `Streamlet` logic.
<4> The code provided is written in pure Spark Structured Streaming code, minus the boilerplate to create sessions, connections, checkpoints, etc. 

Akka Streams and Flink-based `Streamlets` follow the same pattern. 

== Compose the Application Flow with a Blueprint

Once you have developed components as Streamlets, you compose the application's end-to-end flow by creating a _blueprint_. 
The blueprint declares the `streamlet` instances that belong to an application and how each streamlet instance connects to the others.

The following example shows a simple _Blueprint_ definition:

.`blueprint` example
[source, json]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$spark-scala/src/main/blueprint/blueprint.conf[]
----
<1> `streamlets` section: declares instances from the streamlets available in the application (or its dependencies).
<2> `connections` section: declares how the inlets/outlets of a streamlet should be connected.

Note that the declaration of instances in the `streamlets` section supports component reuse by letting you define multiple instances of a streamlet, with potentially different configurations. 
With the `blueprint` file in place, you can verify whether all components in the application are properly connected.

The `verifyBlueprint` function, is part of the `sbt-cloudflow` plugin. 
The following shows example output from running `sbt verifyBlueprint`:

[source, bash]
----
$ sbt verifyBlueprint
[info] Loading settings for project global-plugins from plugins.sbt ...
[info] Loading global plugins from /home/maasg/.sbt/1.0/plugins
[info] Loading settings for project spark-sensors-build from cloudflow-plugins.sbt,plugins.sbt ...
[info] Loading project definition from cloudflow/examples/spark-sensors/project
[info] Loading settings for project sparkSensors from build.sbt ...
[info] Set current project to spark-sensors (in build file:cloudflow/examples/spark-sensors/)
[info] Streamlet 'sensors.MovingAverageSparklet' found
[info] Streamlet 'sensors.SparkConsoleEgress' found
[info] Streamlet 'sensors.SparkRandomGenDataIngress' found
[success] /cloudflow/examples/spark-sensors/src/main/blueprint/blueprint.conf verified.
----

The verification uses the schema information provided by the blueprint to check that all connections between streamlets are compatible. 
Once the blueprint verification succeeds, you know that the components of your streaming application can talk to each other. 
After verification, you can run the complete application. 

IMPORTANT: The verification task is usually performed as a pre-requisite of other tasks, like `runLocal` or `buildApp` that we see next. 
While it's possible to run it independently as shown here, it is most often used indirectly as part of those larger build tasks.

== Test Locally Using the Sandbox

Cloudflow comes with a local execution mode called _sandbox_. The sandbox instantiates all streamlets of an application's blueprint with their connections in a  single, local JVM.

See the sandbox in action in the following screencast.

Running call-record-aggregator  
To terminate, press [ENTER]
----

The sandbox provides you with a minimalistic operational version of the complete application. 
Use it to exercise the functionality of the application end-to-end and verify that it behaves as expected. 
You get a blazing fast feedback loop for the functionality you are developing--removing the need to go through the full package, upload, deploy, and launch process on a remote cluster.

== Publishing the Application Artifacts

Once you are confident that the application functions as expected, you can build and publish its artifacts. 
Cloudflow applications are packaged as Docker images that contain the necessary dependencies to run the different streamlets on their respective backends.
Depending on the project structure, this process will generate one or more Docker images, at least one for each runtime used in the application. 

Those images get published to the Docker repository of your choice, which must be configured in the project.

The process of building the application creates and publishes those Docker images. 
The final result is an application descriptor encoded as a JSON file that can be used with the `kubectl` Cloudflow plugin to deploy the application to a cluster.

The `buildApp` task in the `sbt-cloudflow` plugin loads, verifies, creates and publishes the Docker images, and finally generates the JSON descriptor that we can use to deploy the application. 
The following abridged example shows the different stages that you can observe in the output of this task.

.Stages of Building a Cloudflow Application

<3> The Docker images are built and published

Next, we see how to use the application descriptor to deploy the application to a cluster.


== Deploy with `kubectl` Extensions for a YAML-less Experience 

After testing and packaging, you are ready to deploy the application to a Cloudflow-enabled Kubernetes cluster. 
In contrast with the usual YAML-full experience that typical K8s deployments require, Cloudflow uses the blueprint information and the streamlet definitions to auto-generate an application deployment. 

Cloudflow also comes with a `kubectl` plugin that augments the capabilities of your local `kubectl` installation to work with Cloudflow applications. 
You use your usual `kubectl` commands to `auth` against your target cluster. 
Then, with the `kubectl cloudflow` plugin you can deploy and manage a Cloudflow application as a single logical unit.

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl cloudflow deploy /cloudflow/examples/call-record-aggregator/target/call-record-aggregator.json
----

This method is not only dev-friendly, but is also compatible with the typical CI/CD deployments. 
This allows you to take the application from dev to production in a controlled way.

== Conclusion

As a developer, Cloudflow gives you a set of powerful tools to accelerate the application development process:

* The Streamlet API let's you focus on business value and use your knowledge of widely popular streaming runtimes, like Akka Streams, Apache Spark Structured Streaming, and Apache Flink to create full-fledged streaming applications.
* The blueprint lets you easily compose your application with the peace of mind that a verification phase, informed by schema definitions,  provides.
* The _sandbox_ lets you exercise the complete application in seconds, giving you a real-time feedback loop to speed up the debugging and validation phases.

And with a fully developed application, the `kubectl cloudflow` plugin gives you the ability to deploy and control the lifecycle of your application on an enabled K8s cluster.

Cloudflow takes away the pain of creating and deploying distributed applications on Kubernetes, speeds up your development process, and gives you full control over the operational deployment. 
In a nutshell, it gives you distributed application development super-powers on Kubernetes.
