To open ports in container we need to add at least the port number. This snippet shows how

cloudflow {
  streamlets {
    my-akka-streamlet {
      kubernetes {
        pods.pod.containers.container {
          ports = [
            { container-port=9001},
            { container-port=9002, host-ip="my-ip", protocol = "SCTP", host-port=9999, name="sctp2"}
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

It is possible, as we showed above, to also set host-ip, protocol, host-port and a name. 

Note:
Only Akka Streamlets can open ports
