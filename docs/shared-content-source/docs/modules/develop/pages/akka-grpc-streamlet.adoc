== GrpcServerLogic

=== Use case

An `GrpcServerLogic` can be used to handle gRPC requests.
You need to extend your streamlet from `AkkaServerStreamlet`
so that Cloudflow will expose an HTTP endpoint in Kubernetes.

=== Example

gRPC is a contract-first technology, so you start by adding
the protobuf definition for the service you want to expose
to `src/main/protobuf`. In this example we will implement a
simple request-response service:

[source,protobuf]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$akkastreams-grpc-scala/src/main/protobuf/sensordata.proto[tag=proto]
----

Because the https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc[Akka gRPC plugin] is embedded in
Cloudflow, the code for the service will automatically be generated when you
compile this service. In this case, a `sensordata.grpc.SensorDataService` will be
generated that you can implement.

To expose your implementation,  extend `AkkaServerStreamlet`
and use `GrpcServerLogic` to add your gRPC handlers:

[.tabset]
Scala::
+
[source,scala]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$akkastreams-grpc-scala/src/main/scala/SensorDataIngress.scala[tag=logic]
----

Java::
+
[source,java]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$akkastreams-grpc-java/src/main/java/sensordata/SensorDataIngress.java[tag=logic]
----

In this example, `SensorDataServiceImpl` is your implementation that extends
the generated `sensordata.grpc.SensorDataService`.
`SensorDataServiceHandler`(`Factory`) are also generated classes.

`ServerReflection` comes from the `akka-grpc-runtime` library and allows tools
like https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl[grpcurl] to use
https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-grpc/current/server/reflection.html[Server Reflection]
to discover your API's dynamically.

=== External access

gRPC services use HTTP/2 as a transport mechanism. Cloudflow supports
both HTTP and HTTP/2 on the port exposed by the pod.

There are 3 ways to use HTTP/2:

* With TLS
* Without TLS ('h2c'), using the `Upgrade` mechanism to negotiate between using HTTP/1 and HTTP/2
* Without TLS ('h2c'), without negotiation (which assumes the client has prior knowledge that the server supports HTTP/2)

==== LoadBalancer Service

By creating a service of type `LoadBalancer` you can expose your services using a direct TCP loadbalancer.
This means all features supported by the underlying implementation are available.

Limitations of this approach are that you are restricted to 1 service per IP, and
more advanced features such as TLS termination and path-based routing are not available.

==== Nginx Ingress

The approach described in the xref:administration:providing-external-access-to-cloudflow-services.adoc[Setting up external access]
section will technically work for gRPC services as well, but there are a number of caveats:

Nginx, by default, will only support h2c via the `Upgrade` mechanism. Because this mechanism is more
complicated than the other 2 approaches, client support for this mechanism is not ubiquitous. Also, the
loadbalancer will use HTTP/1 rather than HTTP/2 to the service. While this may happen to work it is
not optimal.

==== GCE Ingress

`gce` (as used in the internal and external HTTP(S) load balancers on Google Kubernetes Engine)
requires the target service to be of type `NodePort`. Because Cloudflow creates services of type
`ClusterIP`, this ingress type cannot be used.
