NOTE: Integration with the Lyft Flink Operator has been deprecated since 2.2.0, and will be removed in version 3.x. Flink integration has moved to the https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow-contrib[Cloudflow-contrib project]. Please see https://lightbend.github.io/cloudflow-contrib/docs/0.1.1/get-started/index.html[the Cloudflow-contrib getting started guide] for instructions on how to use Flink Native Kubernetes integration. The documentation that follows describes the deprecated feature. The FlinkStreamlet API has not changed in cloudflow-contrib, though you do need to use a different dependency and add the `CloudflowNativeFlinkPlugin`, which is described in the https://lightbend.github.io/cloudflow-contrib/docs/0.1.1/get-started/flink-native.html#_building_flink_native_streamlets[Cloudflow contrib documentation for building Flink native streamlets].

The following sections describe how you can create a Flink streamlet.
As mentioned in xref:use-flink-streamlets.adoc[Using Flink streamlets], a Flink streamlet is defined by the following features:

* It is a `Streamlet`. Cloudflow offers a class for implementing Flink streamlets, `FlinkStreamlet` which extends `cloudflow.streamlets.Streamlet`. Any Flink streamlet needs to extend `FlinkStreamlet`.
* It has a shape - we call it `StreamletShape`. Any Flink streamlet needs to define a concrete shape using the APIs available for the `StreamletShape` class, which defines the inlets and outlets of the streamlet.
* It has a `StreamletLogic` that defines how the streamlet generates Flink streaming queries from the business logic.

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple Flink streamlet that accepts data in an inlet and writes them to the console. It can be used to print reports from data that arrives at its inlet. Let's call the streamlet `ReportPrinter`.

== Extending from FlinkStreamlet

Let's start with building the `ReportPrinter` streamlet.
The first thing to do is extend the `cloudflow.flink.FlinkStreamlet` abstract class, as shown below:

The code snippet above shows a class `ReportPrinter` that extends `FlinkStreamlet`.
We have identified the steps needed to complete the implementation (shown by the TODO markers). In the 
next few sections we will complete the implementation one step at a time.

First let's implement inlets and outlets of the streamlet.

== Inlets and outlets

The streamlet that we are building in this tutorial will have one inlet and no outlet.

[NOTE]
====
All inlets, outlets and shape (defined below) need to be annotated with `@transient` in order to prevent serialization.
These structures contain non-serializable objects like an Avro `Schema` which cannot be serialized.
====

Cloudflow supports Avro encoded processing of data - we make this explicit by defining the inlet as `AvroInlet`. `Report` is the
class of objects that will be accepted by this inlet. Inlets defined by `AvroInlet[Report]` will _only_ accept Avro
encoded data for the class `Report`. The class `Report` will be generated by Cloudflow during application build time from the Avro schema that the
user supplies - this ensures that the data which the inlet accepts conforms to the schema that the user had supplied earlier.
As an example we can have the following Avro schema for the `Report` object that contains a report of some of the attributes
of products from an inventory:

[source,json]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$build-flink-streamlets-scala/step1/src/main/avro/Report.avsc[]
----

In the definition of the inlet, "report-in" is the name of the inlet. The inlet should have a domain-specific 
name that describes the nature of the data ingested. We will use this inlet later to read data from it.

[NOTE]
====
This streamlet does not have any outlet. But in general, outlets are defined similarly, `@transient val out = AvroOutlet[Report]("report-out", \_.name)` will
define an outlet that will write Avro encoded data for the object of type `Report`. Here "report-out" is the name of the outlet and `_.name` is the partitioning function that partitions the data from the outlet.
====

== Streamlet Shape

Lets now define the shape of `ReportPrinter` by using the APIs in `cloudflow.streamlets.StreamletShape`:

include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$build-flink-streamlets-java/step2/src/main/java/com/example/ReportPrinter.java[]
----

The above code overrides the `shape` method with a value that defines the shape of the streamlet. `StreamletShape` offers methods to define shapes, e.g. to define a streamlet with two inlets and two outlets, we could write `StreamletShape.withInlets(in0, in1).withOutlets(valid, invalid)`.

The next step is to define the `FlinkStreamletLogic`.

== Defining the `FlinkStreamletLogic`

The `FlinkStreamletLogic` class makes it possible for a user to specify domain logic. It is defined as an abstract class in `cloudflow.flink.FlinkStreamletLogic` and provides an abstract method `buildExecutionGraph` where the user can define the specific logic for the Flink Streamlet.

In this step, we need to override `createLogic` from `FlinkStreamlet` in our `ReportPrinter` class. `createLogic` needs to return an instance of `FlinkStreamletLogic` which will do the processing based on the requirements of `ReportPrinter` object.

include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$build-flink-streamlets-java/step3/src/main/java/com/example/ReportPrinter.java[]
----

In the above code, we override `createLogic` from `FlinkStreamletLogic` with an instance that overrides `buildExecutionGraph` to supply the domain logic for the streamlet. In this case, since we are implementing a printer streamlet for console, all we need to do is read from the inlet that we defined earlier, `val in = AvroInlet[Report]("report-in")`, and do some processing on it.

Note that the processing logic can be quite complex and we can maintain local state as part of the implementation of `FlinkStreamletLogic`.

[NOTE]
====
If the streamlet needs to have local state (`val`{empty}s, `var`{empty}s) for processing logic, it has to be put inside the
`FlinkStreamletLogic` class and _not_ as part of the `Streamlet` class. The `Streamlet` class is used by Cloudflow for extraction
of streamlets using reflection and hence cannot have any state within it.
====


In summary, here are the steps for defining a Flink streamlet:

* Define the inlets and outlets
* Define the concrete shape using the inlets and outlets. The shape of the streamlet is the metadata that will be used by Cloudflow
* Define the custom processing logic that will read data from inlets and write data to outlets


== Using `ReportPrinter` in the blueprint

An example of a blueprint using the `ReportPrinter` could look like this:

[source,hocon]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$build-flink-streamlets-scala/app/src/main/blueprint/blueprint.conf[]
----

The omitted `ReportIngress` could for instance be another `FlinkStreamlet` that writes `Report`{empty}s to its outlet.
