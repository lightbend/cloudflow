Debugging a remote application is possible just by applying the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/conninv.html#Invocation[standard] configuration to debugging a remote JVM. That is, adding a conf like this to JAVA_OPTS through our xref:cloudflow-configuration.adoc[configuration model] before we deploy or configure our Cloudflow app. 

	-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005


As we've seen in the Configuration model, adding these parameters to JAVA_OPTS can be done at the Streamlet level or runtime level. In this example, we are adding it to all Akka streamlets. 

[source, hocon]
----
cloudflow.akka.runtime {
  kubernetes.pods.pod {
    containers.container {
      env = [ 
            { name = "JAVA_OPTS" 
              value = "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005"
            }
          ]
    }
  }
}

Once this is added, and the application is deployed or configured, we'll need to do two things:


1. Add a remote configuration in the IDE of our choice. This remote Run/Debug configuration for the remote JVM must have the same arguments, except for the address set in `JAVA_OPTS`. The address can be different because it belongs to the environment where the IDE is running, typically will be local. See the following for an example configuration:

	-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:4004


2. Port-forward a local address to the selected streamlet/pod in the Kubernetes cluster. Let's say our application is called 'example-application' and we picked the above parameters for the IDE debug configuration. Then we will need to port-forward like the following:

	kubectl port-forward pod/[some-streamlet-pod-name] 4004:5005 -n example-application
