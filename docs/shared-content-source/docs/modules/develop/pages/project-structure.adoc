Cloudflow uses and extends `sbt`, the _Scala Build Tool_, to support the building, packaging, and local execution of applications.
The project structure of a Cloudflow application follows the general conventions and folder structure of an `sbt` project with a few additional considerations.

== The Essential Structure

To create any Cloudflow application, we require the following folder structure and files that we describe next:

.The structure of a Cloudflow project
[source, bash]
----
.
├── build.sbt                 #<1>
├── project                   #<2>
│   ├── build.properties      #<3>
│   ├── cloudflow-plugins.sbt #<4>
│   └── plugins.sbt           #<5>
├── src                       #<6>
│   └── main
└── target-env.sbt            #<7>
----
<1> The `build.sbt` file specifies the build configuration, project dependencies, and eventual sub-projects.
<2> The `project\` folder contains additional configuration for the project build, like plugins and sbt versions. This folder is mandatory.
<3> The `build.properties` file contains the `sbt` version 
<4> The `cloudflow-plugins.sbt` file contains the dependency for the Cloudflow plugin for `sbt` 
<5> In the `plugins.sbt` file 
<6> The `src` folder contains the code for the application.
<7> The `target-env.sbt` file contains the configuration for the Docker registry to use when publishing the application Docker containers.

You might recognize this structure as the typical `sbt` project with a few additional components.
Two particular files that require your attention:

- The `cloudflow-plugins.sbt` adds the repository and plugin version for the Cloudflow `sbt` plugins and,
- the `target-env.sbt` contains the configuration of the Docker registry to use for publishing the resulting Docker images.

In the following sections, we explore the Cloudflow plugin in more detail.
We also review the project setup required for single and multi-runtime projects.

== The Cloudflow Plugin

The Cloudflow plugin is the primary enabler of any Cloudflow application development. 
Internally, it contains several `sbt` plugin definitions that support the building of applications and enable additional functions such as the local _sandbox_, that lets you run the applications on the local machine.

We add the Cloudflow plugin to our application by creating a `cloudflow-plugins.sbt` file in the `project/` folder.

[source, scala]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$akkastreams-scala/project/cloudflow-plugins.sbt[]
----
<1> Adds the `sbt-cloudflow` plugin with a given version to the build definition.

WARNING: The version of the `sbt-cloudflow` plugin defines which version of Cloudflow you are using.
It must match with the version installed in your Kubernetes cluster.

Once the `sbt-cloudflow` plugin is added to the project, a number of plugins become available to your application. 
These plugins are used to enable different facets of an application.

=== Application-level Plugins

The application-level plugins provided by `sbt-cloudflow` are:

The `CloudflowApplicationPlugin`:: The `CloudflowApplicationPlugin` is a SBT plugin for building and publishing the application. 
It provides a target `buildApp` that validates the application against its blueprint, creates and publishes all the Docker images required, and generates the application CR, a JSON document that describes the application and is used by the Cloudflow CLI to initiate the application deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.
+
There must be at-most-one `CloudflowApplicationPlugin` enabled in a Cloudflow application.

The `CloudflowLibraryPlugin`:: The `CloudflowLibraryPlugin` is used when we want to create generic libraries that use Cloudflow concepts, such as data definitions (e.g. `Codec`), AVRO support, Protobuf support, etc.

The `CloudflowLocalRunnerPlugin`:: The `CloudflowLocalRunnerPlugin` adds the `runLocal` task to `sbt` that allows you to run complete Cloudflow application in your local development environment.
+
The `CloudflowLocalRunnerPlugin` does not require an explicit declaration in the build file. 
It is an _autoplugin_ that becomes enabled when the `CloudflowApplicationPlugin` is present.

=== Runtime-specific Plugins

Cloudflow provides out-of-the-box support for Akka, Apache Spark Structured Streaming, and Apache Flink in the form of specific implementations of the Streamlet API and supporting elements, like Docker base images and _runners_ that are able to launch each specific technology stack on Kubernetes.

To develop `Streamlet`{empty}s for a specific runtime, we add the corresponding plugin to the project.
To ensure proper isolation of the different runtimes, we require a different structural approach when using only one runtime or when mixing `Streamlet`{empty}s implementations that use two or more runtimes.
We explore these differences in the next section. 
Before delving into that, here we list the runtime plugins:

`CloudflowAkkaPlugin`:: SBT plugin for creating Akka-based streamlets. 
`CloudflowSparkPlugin`:: SBT plugin for creating Spark Structured Streaming based streamlets.
`CloudflowFlinkPlugin`:: SBT plugin for creating Flink-based streamlets.

[NOTE]
====
Each runtime plugin uses its own default base image. It's `lightbend/akka-base` for Akka, `lightbend/spark` for Spark and `lightbend/flink` for Flink. It could be the case that you're working against your own container registry and therefore prefer to point to your copy or customized version of our base images. To use your base images, set `cloudflowAkkaBaseImage`, `cloudflowSparkBaseImage`, and `cloudflowFlinkBaseImage` in `settings` of the respective runtime plugins in your application `build.sbt`.

In an Akka-based streamlet the default base image value is `lightbend/akka-base:${CloudflowBasePlugin.CloudflowVersion}-cloudflow-akka-$AkkaVersion-scala-${CloudflowBasePlugin.ScalaVersion}`. This may be set to `lightbend/akka-base:2.0.10-cloudflow-akka-2.6.6-scala-2.12` depending on your Cloudflow, Akka and Scala versions. To override this base image in your cloudflow application go to its build.sbt and set up a value in settings such as:

== Single Runtime Applications

Applications that use a single runtime are the simplest form of a Cloudflow application project structure and build definition.
As we see in the next section, we can also combine `Streamlet`{empty}s that use different runtimes in a single application, but that requires a slightly more complex build structure.

Let's explore how to declare a Cloudflow application in a build definition with an example: 

.Single Runtime Setup
[source, scala]
----
include::{cloudflow-examples-version}@docsnippets:ROOT:example$akkastreams-scala/build.sbt[tag=docs-projectSetup-example]
----
<1> use `enablePlugins` to activate the Cloudflow plugins for this project.

NOTE: See the complete example in the https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow/blob/{cloudflow-branch-version}/examples/snippets/modules/ROOT/examples/akkastreams-scala/build.sbt[examples folder of the Cloudflow project] 

We provide templates to get started with a Cloudflow project that uses a single runtime. See
https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow/blob/{cloudflow-branch-version}/examples/templates[templates folder of the Cloudflow project]

== Multiple Runtime Applications

Applications that combine multiple streamlet runtimes *must be* organized using `sbt` https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Multi-Project.html[multi-projects builds].
Streamlets for each runtime must added be into their own separate sub-project.

IMPORTANT: The multi-project build organization is necessary to ensure the correct isolation of the dependencies required by each runtime in their own classpath.
Frameworks like Spark and Flink pack a long list of library dependencies and some of them conflict with each other when placed in the same classloader.
Using multi-project builds ensures the correct functioning of the local _sandbox_ and informs the generation of a Docker image per sub-project with the correct dependencies.

Next to that, we recommend separating the data-oriented schemas into their own sub-project so that streamlet sub-projects can easily import these common data definitions.

For example, if we have an application that uses Akka and Structured Streaming, we could have the following structure:

.Project Structure using Multiple Runtimes

----
<1> The application 'root' project that contains the `blueprint` definition.
<2> The `blueprint.conf` is expected in a `src/main/blueprint` directory by default.
<3> The `datamodel/` folder contains the shared schema definitions.
<4> The `avro/` folder contains the schema definitions in AVRO format. 
<5> `akka-ingestor` is a sub-project that contains Akka-based streamlets
<6> `spark-aggregation` is a sub-project that contains Spark-based streamlets
<7> The `project/` folder contains the `cloudflow-plugins.sbt` and other necessary files as we saw previously.
<8> The `target-env.sbt` contains the Docker repository configuration, as we saw at the start of the chapter.

We can find a `build.sbt` definition that exemplifies the use of a multi-project setup in this https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow/blob/{cloudflow-branch-version}/examples/call-record-aggregator[Cloudflow example]
