== Setting up the Cloudflow `kubectl` Plugin

With Cloudflow installed on a GKE cluster through the Marketplace, you can interact with Cloudflow via its `kubectl` plugin: `kubectl cloudflow`.
If you haven't already, download and set up the `kubectl` plugin following the https://cloudflow.io/docs/current/get-started/prepare-development-environment.html#_download_and_install_the_cloudflow_cli[instructions].

Then connect your local `kubectl` to the GKE cluster on which Cloudflow is installed. You can find the command to do that from the "Clusters" view:

.Connect `kubectl` to GKE cluster

It should look like the following:
[source,bash]
----
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone> --project <gcp-project>
----
Where cluster-name refers to your Kubernetes cluster, as identified https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list[here], and gcp-project refers to your https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects[Google Cloud project].

== Building and Deploying call-record-aggregator

Next we'll deploy a sample Cloudflow application called https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow/tree/master/examples/call-record-aggregator[call-record-aggregator] to the cluster.
Clone the Cloudflow https://github.com/lightbend/cloudflow[Github repo] and `cd` into the `examples/call-record-aggregator` directory. Then run the following command to build the application:

[source,bash]
----
$ sbt buildApp
----
This step may take several minutes to complete, as it will build and push multiple Docker images to the Docker repository configured in `target-env.sbt`.

NOTE: before running `sbt buildApp`, make sure under `call-record-aggregator` directory, you have a file named `target-env.sbt` containing the Docker registry and repository that application images will be pushed to. Refer to `target-env.sbt.example` for an example.

Once it's complete, you should see at the end of the output a `kubectl cloudflow deploy` command to deploy your application. Run it:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl cloudflow deploy call-record-aggregator.json
----

NOTE: You might be prompted to enter credentials for the Docker registry that hosts your application images, if this is your first time deploying an application using that registry.

Once the deployment of the application starts, you can view the progress of the application using the `kubectl cloudflow status` command:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl cloudflow status call-record-aggregator

== Using Lightbend Console
Lightbend Console is a suite of tools provided by Lightbend that enables observing and monitoring Kubernetes applications.
To monitor the call-record-aggregator application you just deployed, run `kubectl port-forward` on the `console-frontend` deployment:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl -n <cloudflow-namespace> port-forward deployment/console-frontend 8080:8080
----

NOTE: Setting up an `Ingress` is the recommended production-ready mechanism of accessing Lightbend Console. Refer to the Console https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/console/current/installation/access.html[documentation] on how to do it.

Now from the browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and you should see the following page:

.Lightbend Console
image::console.png[Lightbend Console]

It shows an overview of current workloads running in the cluster. Click the Cloudflow logo in the "Controls" panel on the upper left corner of the screen.
You will then see a list of Cloudflow applications that you have deployed:

.List of Deployed Cloudflow Applications
image::app-list.png[List of Deployed Cloudflow Applications]

Currently there's only `call-record-aggregator` running.
Click `call-record-aggregator` and you will see a detailed view of the streamlets:

.Call Record Aggregator View
image::cra.png[call-record-aggregator]

Click one of the streamlets and you should see that the data is being processed in the throughput window on the right.

== What's next
This completes the steps need to run access Cloudflow on GCP Marketplace.
