If you have not already installed Cloudflow on a Kubernetes Cluster, please xref:administration:installing-cloudflow.adoc[install Cloudflow] first.

Once the application is built you need to publish the docker images to a container registry that stores, manages and secures your application images. 
In this example we will use a Docker Hub registry.

Follow these steps to complete the process of publishing:

* Set up the target environment of publishing in your local build process. 
Create a file named `target-env.sbt` in the root of your project folder (the same level where you have `build.sbt`). The file needs to have the following 2 lines:

[source,sbt]
.Configure your Docker repository
----
ThisBuild / cloudflowDockerRegistry := Some("docker.io")
ThisBuild / cloudflowDockerRepository := Some("<your docker hub username>")
----

Replace `<docker hub username>` with your Docker Hub username.
Publish the docker image of your project to the above registry. 
Make sure you are logged in with `

  docker login --username <your docker hub username>

and then build and publish the application with

  sbt buildApp

Once the images are successfully published, you will see something like the following as output of `buildApp` in your console:

```
[info] Successfully built and published the following image:
[info]   docker.io/your-user-name/sensor-data-scala:471-89ca008
[success] Cloudflow application CR generated in /.../sensor-data-scala/target/sensor-data-scala.json
[success] Use the following command to deploy the Cloudflow application:
[success] kubectl cloudflow deploy /path/to/sensor-data-scala/target/sensor-data-scala.json
[success] Total time: 41 s, completed Jun 10, 2020 10:10:10 PM
```

At this point, the Docker image containing the streamlets has been published to the Docker repository.
The `sensor-data-scala.json` file that the build produces contains the application descriptor.
We use the Cloudflow CLI to deploy that application description to a cluster.

== Deploy Application to the Cluster

This is quite straightforward and the output of `buildApp` actually tells you what command to run for deployment. 
If your Docker Hub repository is private, you need to supply the credentials along with the CLI `deploy` command, so that Kubernetes can pull the images when the containers are created.
The following example reads a password from a file, and passes it to the `kubectl cloudflow deploy` command using STDIN:

```
$ cat my-dockerhub-password.txt | kubectl cloudflow deploy /path/to/sensor-data-scala/target/sensor-data-scala.json -u <your docker hub username> --password-stdin
```

If your docker repository is public, or if image pull secrets are already setup in your Kubernetes cluster to pull from your docker repository, you can omit credentials with the `--no-registry-credentials` flag, which is shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl cloudflow deploy /path/to/sensor-data-scala/target/sensor-data-scala.json --no-registry-credentials
```

If the command goes through you will see the following output:

```
[Done] Deployment of application `sensor-data-scala` has started.
```

Once all streamlets are up in their pods, you can see them running using the following command:

```
$ kubectl cloudflow status sensor-data-scala 
Name:             sensor-data-scala
Namespace:        sensor-data-scala
Version:          484-199a3c1-dirty

valid-logger      sensor-data-scala-valid-logger-6946746b4b-bpqdc  1/1               Running           0

```

Note that all streamlets run in a namespace that matches the name of the application.

**Congratulations!** You have deployed and started your first Cloudflow application.
