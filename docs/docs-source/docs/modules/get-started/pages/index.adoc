The workflow to build and deploy your first Cloudflow application includes preparing a development environment, coding some streamlets, creating a blueprint to indicate data flow, and running the example. During development, you will likely want to run applications first in a local sandbox and then on a Kubernetes cluster.   

This chapter describes how to build, deploy and run a simple "Wind Turbine" Cloudflow application and deploying it in a local sandbox and on a GKE cluster. Follow the main topics in order:

. xref:prepare-development-environment.adoc[Prepare the development environment]
. xref:wind-turbine-example.adoc[Develop the Wind Turbine example]
.. xref:setup-example-project-configure-build-adoc[Set up example project and configure build]
.. xref:define-avro-schema.adoc[Define Avro schema]
.. xref:develop-example-streamlets.adoc[Develop example streamlets]
. xref:create-example-blueprint.adoc[Create the example blueprint]
. xref:run-in-sandbox.adoc[Run in a local sandbox]
. xref:setup-k8s-cluster.adoc[Set up a Kubernetes cluster]
. xref:deploy-to-gke-cluster.adoc[Deploy to a GKE cluster]
. xref:exercise-example.adoc[Exercise the example]
.. Use CLI helpers such as `status` and `list`
.. Deal with http ingress and push some data to the application
.. Undeploy the application

NOTE:: Check the xref:versions.adoc[versions of dependencies] that Cloudflow supports.

Let's get started by xref:prepare-development-environment.adoc[preparing the development environment].
