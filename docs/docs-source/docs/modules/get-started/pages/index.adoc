= Get started with Cloudflow


include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]


The workflow to build and deploy your first Cloudflow application includes preparing a development environment, coding some streamlets, creating a blueprint to indicate data flow, and running the example. During development, you will likely want to run applications first in a local sandbox and then on a Kubernetes cluster.  This chapter describes how to build a simple "Wind Turbine" Cloudflow application, how to run it locally in the sandbox, and how to deploy and run it on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. 

NOTE: Before deploying on your cluster, check the xref:administration:versions.adoc[versions of dependencies] that Cloudflow supports.

ifdef::review[REVIEWERS: the following are fine-grained tasks, not top-level tasks and since they are covered in the pages above and don't have their own page, I think it's best to leave them off this list.]
//.. Use CLI helpers such as `status` and `list`
//.. Deal with http ingress and push some data to the application
//.. Undeploy the application
