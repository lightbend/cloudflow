Once you have the `sensor-data` Cloudflow application deployed, you can use some CLI helpers to monitor the status of your application.

* **--help** to see all options available

```
$ kubectl cloudflow --help

This command line tool can be used to deploy and operate Cloudflow applications.

Usage:
  cloudflow [command]

Available Commands:
  configure                 Configures a deployed Cloudflow application.
  deploy                    Deploys a Cloudflow application to the cluster.
  help                      Help about any command
  list                      Lists deployed Cloudflow application in the current cluster.
  scale                     Scales a streamlet of a deployed Cloudflow application to the specified number of replicas.
  status                    Gets the status of a Cloudflow application.
  undeploy                  Undeploys a Cloudflow application.
  update-docker-credentials Updates docker registry credentials that are used to pull Cloudflow application images.
  version                   Prints the plugin version.

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for cloudflow

Use "cloudflow [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

* **list** shows all applications deployed in the cluster

```
$ kubectl cloudflow list

## Push data to the Application

Our application uses an http based ingress to ingest data. Follow the following steps to push JSON data through the ingress into the application.

* Get the port details of our ingress streamlet

----

The streamlet exposes its HTTP endpoint for uploading data on port `3000` - let's set up a port forwarding on it.

* Setup port forwarding for the Pod port

[source, text]
----
$ kubectl port-forward sensor-data-http-ingress-fd9cdb66f-jbsrm -n sensor-data-scala 3000:3000
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -> 3000
Forwarding from [::1]:3000 -> 3000
Handling connection for 3000
----

NOTE: The port-forward solution used here is a temporary route to the application from localhost. If you want to create a permanent route that can be accessed by anyone, please see the following chapter on Kubernetes ingresses: xref:ingress-creation.adoc[Providing External Access to Cloudflow Services]

* Push data to the application. In order to do that follow the steps:
** create a json file named `data.json` with the following content:
+ 
.data.json
[source, json]
----
{
  "deviceId": "c75cb448-df0e-4692-8e06-0321b7703992",
  "timestamp": 1495545346279,
  "measurements": {
    "power": 1.7,
    "rotorSpeed": 23.4,
    "windSpeed": 100.1
  }
}
----
** run the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
$curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000 -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @data.json
----

Note that we are using the port number `3000` of `localhost` to which we forward the pod port. This JSON record will pass through the stages of transformation within the pipeline that we defined in the blueprint.

When using this port-forward method, it's also possible to use the same `send-local-data.sh` script that we used to send data to the local sandbox. 
For that, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$./send-local-data.sh 
----

And you should see output similar to the following:
[source, bash]
----

## Verify the Application works

Check the log of the streamlet `valid-logger` to verify that you get the proper transformed metric.

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl logs sensor-data-valid-logger-76884bb775-86pwh -n sensor-data
----

Towards the end of the log you will see something like the following getting printed out:

[source, text]
----

== Undeploy the Application
When we are done experimenting with the application, we can undeploy it to terminate its operations.

[source, bash]
----
$kubectl cloudflow undeploy sensor-data-scala
