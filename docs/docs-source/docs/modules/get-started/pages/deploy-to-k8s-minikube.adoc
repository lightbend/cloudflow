= Deploy the Example to Minikube


include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

This guide shows how to deploy the Cloudflow application using the Minikube `registry` addon.
For more detailed instructions please refer to the official https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/#4-pushing-to-an-in-cluster-using-registry-addon[Pushing images] documentation of Minikube.

Unfortunately Cloudflow does not support changing the `imagePullPolicy` of application images yet (currently fixed to `imagePullPolicy: Always`),
which is required by other (easier) options for pushing images to Minikube.

== Setup

 * Enable insecure registries in Minikube.
 * Enable the `registry` Minikube addon.
 * Configure Docker to use the insecure registry.
 * Configure the target environment.
 * xref:administration:installing-cloudflow.adoc[Install Cloudflow] on Minikube (if you haven't done so already)

We will assume that the Minikube VM has an ip from the `192.168.39.0/24` subnet.
You can verify this once Minikube is started by using `minikube ip`.

Start Minikube with insecure registries and enable the `registry` addon:

   minikube start --kubernetes-version=latest --insecure-registry "10.0.0.0/24,192.168.39.0/24"
   minikube addons enable registry

For configuring Docker to use the Minikube registry as insecure registry, please consult the https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/#deploy-a-plain-http-registry[Deploy a plain HTTP registry]
docs for instructions.

In the case of Linux, add the config to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` as shown below.
Replace `MINIKUBE_IP` with the actual Minikube VM ip obtained via `minikube ip`.

[source,json]
.Linux: Configure Docker to use the insecure Minikube registry
----
{
  "insecure-registries": [ "MINIKUBE_IP:5000" ]
}
----

The last step is to configure the Minikube registry as the target environment in your local build process.

Follow these steps:

 * Create a file named `target-env.sbt` in the root of your project folder (the same level where you have `build.sbt`).
 * Set the registry to `None`.
 * Set the repository to `localhost:5000`. (This allows Minikube to pull the image from its local registry).

The content of the `target-env.sbt` file should like like this:

[source,sbt]
.Configure Docker registry and repository
----
ThisBuild / cloudflowDockerRegistry := None
ThisBuild / cloudflowDockerRepository := Some("localhost:5000")
----

== Building the Application

Now we are ready to build the application with

   sbt buildApp

You should see something like the following as output of `buildApp` in your console:

```
[info] Successfully built and published the following image:
[info] localhost:5000/sensor-data-scala:0.1
[warn] *** WARNING ***
[warn] You haven't specified the "cloudflowDockerRegistry" in your build.sbt
[warn] To have a working deployment you should make the produced docker image available
[warn] in a docker registry accessible from your cluster nodes
[warn] The Cloudflow application CR points to localhost:5000/sensor-data-scala:0.1
[success] Cloudflow application CR generated in /.../sensor-data-scala/target/sensor-data-scala.json
[success] Use the following command to deploy the Cloudflow application:
[success] kubectl cloudflow deploy /.../sensor-data-scala/target/sensor-data-scala.json
[success] Total time: 3 s, completed Jan 27, 2021, 11:52:23 AM
```

You can safely ignore the warnings, those are expected when setting the Docker registry to `None`.

Because we skipped the pushing of the image in the build process we now need to manually push our image to the Minikube registry.
For this we need to create a tag for the Minikube registry which refers to the original image.

   docker tag localhost:5000/sensor-data-scala:0.1 $(minikube ip):5000/sensor-data-scala:0.1
   docker push $(minikube ip):5000/sensor-data-scala:0.1

At this point, the Docker image containing the streamlets has been published to the Minikube Docker registry.
The `sensor-data-scala.json` file that the build produces, contains the application descriptor.
We use the Cloudflow CLI to deploy that application description to a cluster.

== Deploy Application to Minikube

If you have not already installed Cloudflow on Minikube, please xref:administration:installing-cloudflow.adoc[install Cloudflow] first.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that `kubectl` is configured to use the `minikube` context. Verify this by running `kubectl config current-context`.

Because we are using an insecure Docker registry, we need to omit credentials with the `--no-registry-credentials` flag, which is shown in the following example:

```
$ kubectl cloudflow deploy /path/to/sensor-data-scala/target/sensor-data-scala.json --no-registry-credentials
```

If the command goes through you will see the following output:

```
[Done] Deployment of application `sensor-data-scala` has started.
```

Once all streamlets are up in their pods, you can see them running using the following command:

```
$ kubectl cloudflow status sensor-data-scala 
Name:             sensor-data-scala
Namespace:        sensor-data-scala
Version:          484-199a3c1-dirty
Created:          2020-06-10 22:28:32 +0200 CEST
Status:           Running

STREAMLET         POD                                              READY             STATUS            RESTARTS

valid-logger      sensor-data-scala-valid-logger-6946746b4b-bpqdc  1/1               Running           0
validation        sensor-data-scala-validation-b7f85669d-kkpx9     1/1               Running           0

```

Note that all streamlets run in a namespace that matches the name of the application.

**Congratulations!** You have deployed and started your Cloudflow application inside Minikbe.
