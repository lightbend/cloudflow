This guide shows how to install Strimzi and create a Kafka cluster suitable for use with Cloudflow.

Strimzi is a Kubernetes operator that simplifies the process of running Apache Kafka.

== Prerequisites

=== CLI Tools

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed before continuing:

- Helm, version 3 or later
- Kubectl 

== Installing Strimzi

In this guide, we will use Helm to install Strimzi.

We are going to create Strimzi in the `cloudflow` namespace in this guide. Make sure that the namespace `cloudflow` exists before continuing. To create the `cloudflow` namespace, execute

  kubectl create ns cloudflow

Add the Strimzi Helm repository and update the local index.

  helm repo add strimzi https://strimzi.io/charts/
  helm repo update

Install the latest version of Strimzi.

  helm install strimzi strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator --namespace cloudflow

After the install complete, the Strimzi Kafka operator should be running in the `cloudflow` namespace.

----
$ kubectl get pods -n cloudflow
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

=== Creating a Kafka cluster using Strimzi

To create a Kafka cluster using Strimzi, we have to create a `CustomResource` of the kind `Kafka` in the namespace `cloudflow`. 

NOTE: The Kafka cluster configuration shown here is meant for development and testing purposes only. Please consider your storage requirements and modify the custom resource accordingly for your intended usage.

Create the YAML file containing the Kafka custom resource using the following snippet:

[source,shell script]
----
cat > kafka-cluster.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: cloudflow-strimzi
  namespace: cloudflow
spec:
  kafka:
    config:
      auto.create.topics.enable: false
      log.message.format.version: "2.3"
      log.retention.bytes: 1073741824
      log.retention.hours: 1
      log.retention.check.interval.ms: 300000
      log.cleanup.policy: "compact"
      offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3
      transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2
      transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3
    listeners:
      plain: {}
      tls: {}
    livenessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      timeoutSeconds: 5
    readinessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      timeoutSeconds: 5
    replicas: 3
    resources: {}
    storage:
      deleteClaim: false
      size: 100Gi
      type: persistent-claim
    version: 2.4.0
  zookeeper:
    livenessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      timeoutSeconds: 5
    readinessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      timeoutSeconds: 5
    replicas: 3
    resources: {}
    storage:
      deleteClaim: false
      size: 10Gi
      type: persistent-claim
EOF
----

Apply the YAML file with the Kafka custom resource to the cluster:

  kubectl apply -f kafka-cluster.yaml

When the Strimzi Kafka operator has processed the custom resource, there should be six new pods in the `cloudflow` namespace. Three Kafka broker pods and three Zookeeper pods.

----
$ kubectl get pods -n cloudflow
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cloudflow-strimzi-kafka-0                  2/2     Running   0          1m
cloudflow-strimzi-kafka-1                  2/2     Running   0          1m
cloudflow-strimzi-kafka-2                  2/2     Running   0          1m
cloudflow-strimzi-zookeeper-0              1/1     Running   0          2m
cloudflow-strimzi-zookeeper-1              1/1     Running   0          2m
cloudflow-strimzi-zookeeper-2              1/1     Running   0          2m
strimzi-cluster-operator-9968fd8c9-fhqmj   1/1     Running   0          5m
----

TIP: If you want to change any parameters of the Kafka cluster, edit the `kafka-cluster.yaml` file and apply it again to the cluster, as shown above. The Strimzi Kafka cluster operator will make the necessary changes when detecting an update of the custom resource.

=== Removing Strimzi 

If you want to remove Strimzi, you can do that with the following Helm command:

  helm delete strimzi -n cloudflow

You can find all Helm releases installed in the `cloudflow` namespace by executing the following command:

  helm ls -n cloudflow
