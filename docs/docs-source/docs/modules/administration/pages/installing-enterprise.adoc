This instruction shows how to install the Cloudflow Enterprise components. These components are available to https://www.lightbend.com/lightbend-subscription[Lightbend Subscription] customers.

== Installing Enterprise components

Before installing, you need to make sure you have the https://portal.lightbend.com/LightbendPlatform/Credentials[credentials] required to download the cloudflow-enterprise components from the Lightbend commercial repository.

Add the Lightbend Helm repository and update the local index:

  helm repo add cloudflow-helm-charts https://lightbend.github.io/cloudflow-helm-charts/
  helm repo update

Install the components, note that you set the `$DOCKER_USERNAME` and `$DOCKER_PASSWORD` environment variables before executing this command. Set `$DOCKER_USERNAME` and `$DOCKER_PASSWORD` to the https://portal.lightbend.com/LightbendPlatform/Credentials[username and password of the Lightbend commercial repository]. 

We recommend using the following command to create an environment variable for username and password (here username/password are your credentials to the Lightbend docker repository - bintray).
*This is to avoid storing this information in the shell's history file.*

  read DOCKER_USERNAME
  read -s DOCKER_PASSWORD



TIP: If you want to see the password typed in, remove the `-s` (for silent) flag.

Once configured, we can execute the Helm command to install the Cloudflow enterprise components. Note how we use the `$DOCKER_USERNAME` and `$DOCKER_PASSWORD` in the Helm command.

[source,shell script,subs="attributes+"]
----
helm install cloudflow-enterprise-components cloudflow-helm-charts/cloudflow-enterprise-components \
  --namespace cloudflow \
  --version "{cloudflow-version}" \
  --set enterpriseOperator.version={cloudflow-version} \
  --set enterprise-suite.imageCredentials.username="$DOCKER_USERNAME" \
  --set enterprise-suite.imageCredentials.password="$DOCKER_PASSWORD"
----

After we have used the username and password environment variables, we can clear them by closing the shell or executing the following commands:

  unset DOCKER_USERNAME
  unset DOCKER_PASSWORD

To quickly verify that the installation worked, you can open a proxy to the Lightbend console service and confirm that you can access the Lightbend console UI.

First, create the port-forward.

  kubectl port-forward -n cloudflow svc/console-server 5000:80

Then open the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:5000

This opens the Lightbend Console in your browser.

== Upgrading Cloudflow

If you need to upgrade Cloudflow to a newer version, xref:upgrading-cloudflow.adoc[] in the administration section will show you how.
