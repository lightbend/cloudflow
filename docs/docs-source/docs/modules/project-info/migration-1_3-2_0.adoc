The 2.0 release contains several new features that require changes to the project structure, blueprint definition, and build process.

In this guide, we describe the changes that you need to apply to a pre-2.0 Cloudflow application to make it compatible with the new model.

WARNING: Be aware that the server-side components need to be updated to the Cloudflow 2.0 release to run a 2.0-compliant application.
