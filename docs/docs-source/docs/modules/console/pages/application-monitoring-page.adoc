The following screen shot shows the monitoring page for an example `call-record-pipeline` application. Blue arrows call out the main components. From the top left working clockwise, these include:

* *Controls* - icons to navigate to the *GRAFANA* dashboard or the infrastructure *WORKLOADS* view.
* The blueprint graph pane, available in different themes
* The *VIEW* selector, which allows you to select the time period
* *Metrics* - graphs of *Consumer lag* and *Throughput records* along with other key metrics
* A *Selection:* - pane that identifies the current selection and lets you choose between viewing *Health* and streamlet *Shape*

This page describes application monitoring page elements, except for the Blueprint graph panel, which is described on the xref:blueprint-graph.adoc[Blueprint Graph] page.


== Controls

image::pl-doc-controls.png[Controls,146,float="right",title="Controls"]

The top level controls panel is the jumping off point for other views on the current selection: metric dashboards (via Grafana) or infrastructure monitoring


== Application Details panel

The leftmost *Application Details* panel shows application status. It includes the current (i.e. _live_) health rolled up from all streamlets and summarizes health transitions per streamlet over the current _time period_. *Streamlet Health Events* bars show the relative amount of time over the duration that each streamlet spent in an unhealthy condition. Red indicates critical health, and orange indicates warning. Streamlets in this list are ordered by their amount of health issues and are weighted by severity.

== Health and timeline panel

The *Application Health* panel displays the health of the current selection--which can be either the application or a streamlet--over the selected time period. The health model used in Lightbend Console is based on a hierarchical rollup of health from monitors to streamlets (or workloads) to applications as a whole.

== Selection pane

The *Selection:* pane identifies the selected application or streamlet. Use the tabs in this panel to show health bars for the current selection. Additional content is available when a single streamlet is selected.

image::pl-doc-tabs.png[Tabs,244,float="right",title="Tabs"]

=== Health tab

With the *Health* tab selected, this panel shows health bars for the current selection. When the application is selected, by clicking the background of the blueprint diagram, this panel contains streamlet health. It displays one streamlet per row. When a streamlet is selected, the panel contains monitor health, one row per monitor.

As in the blueprint view, health information is available for four states.

image::pl-doc-health-colors.png[Health colors,image,height="24",title="Health colors"]

Use *SORT BY* to order the health bars by:

* *Name* (streamlet or monitor)
* *First-unhealthy* (default) - orders by the first sample in each health metric to turn warning or critical.
* *Most-unhealthy* - the summation of the number of samples over the duration that are either warning or critical - where critical has twice the weight as warning.


=== Shape tab: inlet, outlet, and endpoint details [[shape]]

Click the *Shape* tab to show details on the inlets and outlets of the selected streamlet. In the upper portion of the panel,
a graphic shows the streamlet along with its named ports colored by their schema type.

image::pl-doc-shape-view.png[Shape view,align="center",title="Shape view"]

Below this is the URL of exposed endpoints (if any) followed by an expandable list of port details including
the port name, schema type, current values of key performance metrics and upstream or downstream
connections. Clicking on a connection in the list will select that upstream or downstream streamlet.

*Consumer Lag* metrics are defined on each inlet and *Throughput* metrics are defined on both inlet and
outlets. The values shown for these metrics are valid for the _current-time_. If you mouse over
the main timeline (or a graph) and thus change the current-time you'll see these values change as well.
In this manner you can correlate exact values for these key performance metrics with other metrics
from this streamlet. See xref:application-monitoring-overview.adoc#kpm[Key performance metrics] for more information.

These key metrics are based upon reading from or writing data to Kafka, the message bus behind the scenes.
Inlets connect to Kafka via a consumer-group while outlets are written to topics. Both of these are shown in the details.

== Metric Graphs panel

Graphs of metrics for the _current selection_ are shown in the right-most panel.
There are two basic graph representations: paired-stack graphs and area graphs. Throughput is depicted as an upper/lower
stacked graph where all the incoming data are shown on top and the out-going throughput data on bottom. Each upper
and lower graph could contain multiple sources and they are stacked upon each other.

Area graphs show one or more curves overlaid upon each other. See xref:application-monitoring-overview.adoc#kpm[Key performance metrics] for more information.

Currently applications only produce one family of high level metrics: *Throughput*, shown in a paired-stack graph:

image::pl-doc-throughputGraph.png[Application throughput graph,align="center",title="Application throughput graph"]

When a streamlet is selected, the right-most panel displays metric graphs
relating to that streamlet:

image::pl-doc-streamlet-graphs.png[Streamlet graphs,align="center",title="Streamlet graphs"]

Each streamlet monitor is based upon a metric exported by the streamlet. When combined
with an expression (based on the monitor type) and other parameters a monitor is
defined. The metrics backing up most monitors are graphed in this panel.

In addition there are other key metrics for each streamlet type. Metrics in this
category include consumer-lag (for each streamlet inlet),
throughput (on streamlet inlets and outlets), number of instances running (scale) and restart history are
also shown in this panel. See xref:application-monitoring-overview.adoc#kpm[Key performance metrics] for more information.

When a streamlet outputs several metrics with the same name but with
different labels then a single graph is created for the collection of metrics. As you mouse over
the graph you'll see, along with the crosshairs, each curve highlight. Curves occluded
by others cannot be highlighted, so hover over an indicator chip in the upper right. This
will highlight the curve (increasing its opacity) as well as show unique labels. In this example there are two labels with values unique to curve: container & pod.

Most graphs display a description tooltip on graph-title hover.
