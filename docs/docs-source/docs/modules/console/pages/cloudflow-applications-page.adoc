The **Cloudflow Applications** page provides an entry point for Cloudflow-specific information. In the **Deployed Applications** pane, each tile represents one running Cloudflow application. Tiles contain basic information about the application (name, resource counts, how long it has been deployed, etc) along with a (live) thumbnail view of the blueprint and the health history over the current time period. 

TIP: To drill into an application's monitoring page, click its tile.

The panel to the left of the **Deployed Applications** pane contains:

* a **Workloads** link to the *Cluster Map* infrastructure view
* a list of cluster resources being used for Cloudflow applications
* a summary of application health organized by current health
