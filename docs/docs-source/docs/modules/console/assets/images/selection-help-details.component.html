    <div class="prose">
      This web-application is used to validate and monitor a Lightbend Cloudflow application.
      Here you can get visual verification that your application looks as you expect, with the correct
      streamlets and the proper connections each with the desired schema. In addition you can watch
      your application run, checking on key performance indicators, such as latency and throughput, as
      well as the health of each streamlet and the monitors computed on them.

      <br>
      The entry point for Lightbend Cloudflow is the applications page. Each running Cloudflow application is
      represented with a 'tile'. Each tile contains basic information about the application (name, resource counts,
      how long it has been deployed, etc) along with a (live) thumbnail view of the blueprint and the health history
      over the current time period. Click on a tile to go to that application's monitoring page.
      <br>
      <p>To the left of the application tiles are panels containing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a link to the cluster view</li>
        <li>cluster resources being used for Cloudflow applications</li>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Fundamental Concepts: Current Period, Time and Selection</h3>
    <div class="prose">In this monitoring application all views (panels) are tightly coupled. Making a selection in one frequently
      affects most others. There are two main selection types used here (1) the application or (2) a streamlet. By default the
      application is selected - and when the page first loads you'll see the center panel full of rows of health bars, one for each
      streamlet in the application. If you click a streamlet in the blueprint diagram or click a health bar title the application will then focus
      all panels on that streamlet - as it becomes the <span class="key-concept">current selection</span>.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">Similarly there is a <span class="key-concept">current time</span>. The current-time is whatever time you've hovered over
      in a graph, health bar or timeline - it is a very transient concept which is constantly changing based on the position of the mouse in these panels.
      The current-time is visualized by a vertical crosshair in each time-based panel (graphs, health bars) and is reflected in the time callout in
      both the main timeline as well as the blueprint panel. As you hover within a graph or health bar this current time changes
      to track the mouse. If you mouse out of these panels then the current time snaps to 'NOW' (the most recent time sample) -
      you'll see this in the time callout in the blueprint graph with a <span class="key-concept">'( live )'</span> label. Note: due to metric sampling
      (see observation period below) this most-recent sample could be within seconds of 'now' or minutes in the past (latency is a function of the
      observation period).
    </div>
    <a href="#time-period-control"></a>
    <div class="prose"><img class="inset flow-around-right" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-time-period.png" width="144"/>
      The duration of interest, or observation period, is governed by the <span class="key-concept">time period </span> as selected in the upper right hand
      corner of the screen.  The options available include: 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day and 1 week.
      Metrics are collected from streamlets at one rate (currently 10 second intervals) but health bars and graphs are calculated by sampling these underlying
      metrics. The observation period (i.e. the time period) determines the sampling rate for all collected metrics.
      This sampling rate governs the temporal resolution of displays (health bars & graphs).
      Ten second sampling is used for one hour duration (360 samples / hour), 40 seconds for a four hour duration, etc. Select a short observation period
      for low latency.

      Metrics are streamed (based on this sampling rate) and the current status of the update cycle is visualized in the top navigation bar
      <img class="inset flow-around-left" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-update-icon.png" width="213px"/>.
      During an update cycle (while the clock is orange) the blueprint and graphs are incrementally updating. When the clock turns green the cycle is complete.

      <br>The health of a monitor or streamlet at any point in time is determined as the 'worst' health over all collected time samples within its interval.
      However metrics shown in graphs are instantaneous samples and only reflect the state of the system at the time of collection.
    </div>
    <a href="#blueprintGraph"></a>
    <h2 class="header">Blueprint Graph</h2>
    <div class="prose">The blueprint graph shows the current state of the application as a directed graph of streamlets with dataflow
      from left to right.
      Each streamlet is depicted with a 'service type' (Akka Streams or Spark Streaming) icon, a name, instance count and ports.
      <img class="inset" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-dag0.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Blueprint Themes</h3>
    <div class="prose">
      Three blueprint-based ‘themes’ are available for visualizing state in the blueprint. Each theme maps a streamlet metric
      into the streamlet icon color within the blueprint and another metric into the connections (color and line thickness) between streamlets.
      The legend below the blueprint is where you select the theme as well as understand the mappings and metric ranges
      (based on the current <span class="key-concept">time period</span>).
      <img class="inset" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-blueprint-controls.png" width="100%"/>
      As you ‘scrub’ over a health bar or metric graph on the page you’ll see streamlet and connections change color
      to reflect their color mapping at the current time.
      <br><br>
      <table class="theme-table">
        <thead  class="theme-head">
          <td class="theme-cell"><b>theme</b></td>
          <td class="theme-cell"><b>streamlet color</b></td>
          <td class="theme-cell"><b>connection color and thickness</b></td>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Activity</td>
            <td>Sum of Throughput Across all Inlets</td>
            <td>Consumer Lag (of target streamlet)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Health</td>
            <td>Streamlet Monitor Health</td>
            <td>Connection Schema</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Latency</td>
            <td>Streamlet Processing Time</td>
            <td>Consumer Lag (of target streamlet)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <br><br>
      ‘Health’ is the default view. In this theme the streamlet icon’s color is based on its health
      <div class="prose">
        <img class="inset center" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-health-colors.png" height="24"/>
      </div>
      at the current time and connections are colored based on their schema. Health is defined as the least healthy of all the streamlet’s
      monitors at that time. This mapping is categorical in that neither health nor schema are continuous variables
      (for a given time) and thus the legend, below the blueprint, shows distinct states for both streamlet and connection
      mapping (of course health is a time-varying metric). Hovering over the color chips within the legend shows the details of the chip.
      <img class="inset" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-health-theme.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The ‘Activity’ theme maps throughput into streamlet icon color: specifically the sum of the outlets throughputs. Connections are visualized
      based on consumer lag (both for color and line thickness). In this manner for a given streamlet we’re visualizing its inlet pressure (consumer lag)
      and the streamlet’s effort at servicing that pressure (the rate of data production: the outlet
      throughput). The goal of this theme is to give the user a sense of the level of activity of both the Cloudflow as a whole as well
      as individual streamlets. These two mappings are continuous and the colormaps in the legend reflect this. In both cases
      (throughput and consumer lag) the colormap is scaled by the min-to-max range of all streamlets and connections for the current
      <span class="key-concept">time period</span>.
      <img class="inset" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-activity-theme.png" width="100%"/>
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      ‘Latency’, the third theme, gives a measure of the inlet pressure (like ‘activity’ it uses consumer
      lag on connections) and processing time (for Akka Streams-based streamlets) for coloring the streamlet icons. In this manner
      it gives a feeling for the amount of work the streamlet is performing at the current time.
      <img class="inset" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-latency-theme.png" width="100%"/>
      Note that not all streamlets produce processing time metrics (currently spark-based streamlets do not provide processing time
      metric data) and these streamlets are always gray (as shown in the above image).
      <br><br>
      In general the color scheme for continuous variables (processing time, throughput and consumer lag) uses green to indicate ‘good’
      and orange or pink to indicate ‘problematic’. Blue is used for more ambiguous states (like low throughput or low processing time)
      where  value judgment isn’t relevant.
      <br><br>
      One side benefit of this mapping is that you can get a feeling for how the streamlet is performing relative to the entire observation
      period as well as among its peers.
    </div>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Streamlet Iconography</h3>
    <div class="prose">
      <img class="inset top flow-around-left" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-instance-count.png" width="150"/>
      Each streamlet icon within the blueprint consists of several visual elements:
      <ul>
        <li>Service type icon (akka or spark - as in the image to the right)</li>
        <li>Ports for incoming or outgoing connections to other streamlets</li>
        <li>Streamlet scale (shown when more than one instance is running)</li>
        <li>Endpoint (the blue cloud-like icon on the streamlet right side)</li>
      </ul>
      Schemas are defined for each inlet and outlet port and, in the health theme, both ports and wires are colored by schema type,
      allowing you to get a quick sense of which ports are compatible. These schema colors are also used in the 'shape' details
      panel (see below).
      <br><br>
      Streamlets can be scaled. The scale of each streamlet is visualized below the streamlet icon. This
      streamlet consists of three instances (pods).
    </div>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Setting the Current Selection</h3>
    <div class="prose"><span class="key-concept">Current Selection</span> Selecting a streamlet, by clicking on it, focuses the rest of the page
      on this selection. Clicking the background of the blueprint graph selects the application as a whole. The blueprint graph resizes with the window
      size, so the selection highlight effect depends on the resolution of the display and the complexity of the blueprint. This ranges from a very
      simple callout (for narrow window sizes), to a full resolution icon with a solid white outline for larger window sizes.

    <div class="prose">
      <img class="inset flow-around-left" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-pipeline-details.png" width="144"/>
      The leftmost panel contains application status including the current (i.e. <span class="key-concept">live</span>)
      health rollups by streamlet as well as a summary of health transitions per streamlet over the current <span class="key-concept">time period</span>.
      <br><br>
      The amount of red (critical) and orange (warning) indicates the relative amount of time over the duration that the streamlet spent
      in an unhealthy condition. Streamlets in this list are ordered by their amount (weighted by severity) of health issues.

      <br>
      The center panel visualizes the health of the current selection (either application or streamlet) over the time period.
      The health model used in Lightbend Console is based on a hierarchical rollup of health from monitors to streamlets
      (or workloads) to applications as a whole.

      Use the tabs in this panel to show health bars for the current selection (either application or streamlet).
      When the current selection is a single streamlet then additional content is available.
      <br><br>
      The 'shape' tab contains information regarding inlets and outlets: schema, throughput and consumer lag metrics (at the current time),
      as well as the endpoint exposed (if any) and the streamlet scale.
    </div>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Health</h3>
    <div class="prose">
      This panel shows health bars for the current selection. When the application is selected (by clicking the background of the blueprint diagram)
      then this panel contains streamlet health, one streamlet per row. When a streamlet is selected then the panel contains monitor health
      (one row per monitor).

        <li>first-unhealthy (default)</li>
        <li>most-unhealthy</li>
      </ul>
      'First Unhealthy' simply orders by the first sample in each health metric to turn warning or critical.
      'Most Unhealthy' ordering is based on the summation of
       the number of samples over the duration that are either warning or critical - where critical has twice the weight as warning.
    </div>
    <h3 class="sub-header">Shape: Inlet, Outlet and Endpoint Details</h3>
    <div class="prose">
      Click the 'Shape' tab and this panel changes to show details on the inlets
      and outlets of the selected streamlet. In the upper portion of the panel
      a graphic shows the streamlet along with its named ports colored by their schema type.
      <img class="inset center" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-shape-view.png" width="100%" style="max-width:450px"/><br>
      Below this is the URL of exposed endpoints (if any) followed by an expandable list of port details including
      the port name, schema type, current values of key performance metrics and upstream or downstream
      connections. Clicking on a connection in the list will select that up/downstream streamlet.
      <br><br>
      Consumer Lag metrics are defined on each inlet and Throughput metrics are defined on both inlet and
      outlets (please see: <span class="link" (click)="changeTopic('keyPerformanceMetrics')">this</span>).
      The values shown for these metrics are valid for the <span class="key-concept">current-time</span>. If you mouse over
      the main timeline (or a graph) and thus change the current-time you'll see these values change as well.
      In this manner you can correlate exact values for these key performance metrics with other metrics
      from this streamlet.
      <br><br>
      These key metrics are based upon reading from or writing data to Kafka, the message bus behind the scenes.
      Inlets connect to Kafka via a consumer-group while outlets are written to topics. Both of these are shown in the details.

    <a href="#metricGraphs"></a>
    <h2 class="header">Metric Graphs</h2>
    <div class="prose">
      Graphs of metrics for the <span class="key-concept">current selection</span> are shown in the right-most panel.
      There are two basic graph representations: paired-stack graphs and area graphs. Throughput is depicted as an upper/lower
      stacked graph where all the incoming data are shown on top and the out-going throughput data on bottom. Each upper
      and lower graph could contain multiple sources and they are stacked upon each other.
      <br>
      Area graphs show one or more curves overlaid upon each other.
      <br>
      Currently applications only produce one family of high level metrics: Throughput.
      (please see: <span class="link" (click)="changeTopic('keyPerformanceMetrics')">Key Performance Metrics</span>)

      Shown in a paired-stack graph.
      <br><br>
      Whenever a streamlet is selected the right-most panel displays metric graphs
      relating to that streamlet.
      <img src="../../../assets/pl-doc-streamlet-graphs.png" class="inset center" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px"/>

      Each streamlet monitor is based upon a metric exported by the streamlet. When combined
      with an expression (based on the monitor type) and other parameters a monitor is
      defined. The metrics backing up most monitors are graphed in this panel.
      <br>
      In addition there are other key metrics for each streamlet type. Metrics in this
      category include consumer-lag(for each streamlet inlet),
      throughput(on streamlet inlets and outlets), number of instances running (scale) and restart history are
      also shown in this panel.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">When a streamlet outputs several metrics with the same name but with
      different labels then a single graph is created for the collection of metrics. As you mouse over
      the graph you'll see, along with the crosshairs, each curve highlight. Curves occluded
      by others cannot be highlighted, so hover over an indicator chip in the upper right. This
      will highlight the curve (increasing its opacity) as well as show the labels unique to this
      curve below the graph.
      <img src="../../../assets/pl-doc-graph-annotated.png" class="inset center" width="100%" style="max-width: 450px"/>

    <h3 class="sub-header">Key Performance Metrics</h3>
    <div class="prose">
      <span class="key-concept">Consumer Lag</span> is a key metric available for streamlet inlets.
      Each inlet is part of a Kafka Consumer Group across all the instances of that streamlet.
      If there is one instance of the streamlet, it is a group of one. The group members divide
      up the kafka partitions of the topic they are reading. Every partition has a lag or latency measurement,
      which is how far back the consumer group reader is from the most recent message. This metric
      is captured in terms of the number of records each reader (instance) is behind
      the most recent record produced upstream - and is presented as the maximum across all readers in the group.
      <br>
      <span class="key-concept">Throughput</span>, another key metric is available on both inlets and
      outlets. On streamlet inlets it represents the rate of data records read by the streamlet (in records / second).
      On outlets it is the rate of data records produced by the streamlet. It is useful to note that there might not be a one-to-one
      relationship between inlet records and outlet records. This relationship is dependent on the functionality of the streamlet itself.
      <br><br>
      For application throughput we compare incoming data (i.e. the data produced on all outlets of all ingress's)
      with outgoing data (i.e. the data consumed on all inlets of all egress streamlets in the application).
      Incoming data is shown in the upper stack, outgoing on the bottom stack as in the following image.

    <div class="prose">As you move the mouse over a graph you'll see
      the crosshair track the mouse. A timeline callout appears below the graph. In addition you'll see
      a small vertical line drawn on all graphs, health bars and timelines on the page - allowing you
      to correlate behavior across metrics, monitors and streamlets. When hovering over a metric graph, the vertical crosshair
      shows the (up to six) metric values (one per curve) at the current time.  Callout values are shown if the mouse is within one
      time sample from the mouse location - meaning that unknown (missing) data is not shown.

      There is a Grafana metric dashboard for each streamlet as well as one for the application as a whole (based on the current selection).
      In these dashboards you can see a variety of
      metrics for each service type of the current selection (Kafka, Akka Streams, Spark, JVM and Kubernetes) separated into groups. Here you also
      have finer-grain control over time periods and other graphing attributes

    <h3 class="sub-header">Relationship with Lightbend Console Monitoring</h3>
    <div class="prose">There are two main views for monitoring Lightbend-enabled applications: the infrastructure and Cloudflow Applications views.
      In the Cloudflow Application view you see a blueprint and streamlet-oriented frame of reference: all information is structured for a higher level perspective
      on a running Cloudflow-enabled application: where the main actors are the blueprint, its constituent streamlets, their monitors and metrics. Health
      at the application level is based on rolling up health at the streamlet level which is based on rolling up health at the monitor level.

      <img class="inset flow-around-left" src="../../../assets/pl-doc-controls.png" width="146px"/>
      Another viewpoint is infrastructure-oriented: a cluster consists of nodes running pods (you can reach this view by clicking
      on the 'workload' icon within the controls panel in the window upper left). Those pods are organized by the workloads in which they are running.
      Workloads have monitors running on pods and the health of the workload is based on rolling up the health of its monitors. This infrastructure-based
      view does not have a high level concept of 'application' but it does allow you to define or customize monitors for workloads.  While this
      customization is not available directly in the Cloudflow-based view, those monitors do carry over to the Cloudflow perspective.

      This is the corresponding infrastructure view for this Cloudflow application. Note that there are 11 workloads here (three with two pods each
      all others with one).
      But the Cloudflow view contains eight streamlets. This discrepancy is due to how spark jobs are handled: they have an executor and driver -
      resulting in an additional workload for each spark streamlet - or three additional workloads for this application (since there are three
      spark-based streamlets). For more information on infrastructure monitoring see <a target="_blank" href="{{docUrl}}">here</a>
