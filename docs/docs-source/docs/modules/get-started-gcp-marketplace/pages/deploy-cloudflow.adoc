== Deploying Cloudflow

You have followed the xref:find-cloudflow-on-gcp-marketplace.adoc[previous step] of locating Cloudflow in the Marketplace catalog and now see the following screen:

.The Cloudflow page on Marketplace

Spend some time reading through the information on the page, especially the section on pricing. When you are ready, click "Configure" to proceed to the deployment screen:

.The Cloudflow Configuration and Deployment Page

On this page, you have the ability to configure a few parameters before deploying Cloudflow. First, you'll need a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.
If you have an existing cluster, you may select it from the dropdown menu.
Or you can quickly spin up a new cluster in your preferred cluster zone by clicking the "Create cluster" button.
Note that your existing cluster may not be available for selection if it does not meet the resource requirements, in which case you'll also need to create a new cluster.

Once your cluster is up and running, go through the other configuration options.
Some of them have a tooltip next to them that explains the purpose of that configuration option.
When you've verified all configuration values, click "Deploy" to deploy Cloudflow.

After some time you should see the following page:

.The Cloudflow Deployment Status

It shows that the components of Cloudflow are being installed, while "some components are pending".
Wait another minute and then refresh the page, the warning message should be gone and you'll see a check mark next to the Cloudflow logo.

== What's next
Now you have Cloudflow deployed on a GKE cluster, you are ready to xref:run-sample-application.adoc[run a sample Cloudflow application].
